Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
 
Example 1:
 
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3

count=1
for i in nums:
	if((nums[i]==1) & (nums[i]==nums[i+1])):
	count+=1
	else:
	count=1
return count

(name, id)
[("a",1), ("b",2), ("a",3)]

a 4
b 2
